# LeetCode JavaScript Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode JavaScript solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems implemented in JavaScript. Whether you're a fellow programmer looking for solutions, a potential employer reviewing my coding skills, or just someone interested in algorithmic problem-solving, you've come to the right place.

## Getting Started

To access a specific problem solution, navigate to the corresponding directory in the repository. Each directory is named after the problem's LeetCode title or ID, and within each directory, you'll typically find:

1. A JavaScript file (e.g., `solution.js`) containing the code.
2. A README or comments within the JavaScript file explaining the problem statement and my approach.

Please note that these solutions are for reference and learning purposes. 
While I've made an effort to ensure their correctness, there may be edge cases or improvements that can be made.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

LeetCode
--001-Two_Sum
  --twoSum.js
--002-Palindrome_Number
  --palindromeNumber.js
--....

Feel free to explore the specific problem directories to find the JavaScript solutions you're interested in.

## Contributing
